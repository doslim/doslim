### About Me
- 👀 My research interests mainly lie in the intersection of three directions:
  - Designing advanced methods for business intelligence.
  - Evaluating intelligent agents in terms of social, ethical and human-interaction aspects.
  - Reshaping traditional business process (e.g., talent selection and evaluation) with new technologies.
- ✨ I currently focus on recommender systems and large language models.
- 🙌 I'm looking to collaborate on machine learning applications in social science and business 🤝.
